# Contributing
If you wish to contribute to the discord.js codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your coding process.

## Setup
To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`, or `npm install --no-optional` if you're not working on voice
3. Code your heart out!
4. Run `npm test` to run ESLint
5. Run `npm run docs` to build any documentation changes
6. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/compare)
